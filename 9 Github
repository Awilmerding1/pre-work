Creating a Git Repo

1. Inside of the project directory that you want to track, initiate a git directory:
    git init
2. Add a specific file in your project directory to the git directory:
    git add <FileName>
3. OR add all files:
    git add .
4. Commit the changes we made to any files that we "added" to the git directory:
    git commit -m "descriptive commit message"

Copying a Git Repo

1. Copy the SSH link from the repository you want to clone:
    Repo Link: https://github.com/facebook/react
    SSH Link: git@github.com:facebook/react.git
2. Clone the repo to your computer:
    git clone git@github.com:facebook/react.git
3. Enter the cloned directory:
    cd react

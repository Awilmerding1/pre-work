1. Create a local variable that points to an array with 5 string elements
  puts out the 3rd element in the array

  myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
  puts myArray[2]

  2. Create a local variable that points to an hash with 5 key-value pairs
    puts out the value of your third key-value pair

    myHash = {first: 1, second: 2, third: 3, fourth: 4, fifth: 5}
    puts myHash[:third]

  3. Add a new element to the end of your array. Remove the first TWO elements from the beginning of your array
      NOTE: what is the return value of both of these?

      myArray.push("new element")
      myArray.shift(2)

  4. Add a new key-value pair to your hash

      myHash[:sixth]= 6

  5. Define a method that accepts three arguments: a hash, a key and an array
    Add a new key-value pair to the passed in hash using the array as the value
    Return the new hash

    def myMethod(hash, key, array)
      hash[key] = array
      return hash
    end
